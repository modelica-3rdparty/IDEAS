<p>
This package contains validation models for the <a href=\"modelica://IDEAS.Fluid.PVTCollectors.Validation.PVT_UN\">PVT_UN</a> collector 
(referred to as <code>PVT2</code> in Meertens et al., 2025), 
an uncovered and uninsulated PVT collector, 
based on experimental data from a long-term outdoor test campaign in Austria (Veynandt et al., 2023).
</p>
<p>
The dataset spans 58 consecutive summer days with 5-second resolution, capturing a wide range of operating conditions. 
Notably, the test period includes days with several hours of very high wind speeds, reaching up to <i>10–12&nbsp;m/s</i>, 
which significantly affect convective heat losses.
</p>
<p>
The package includes two models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://IDEAS.Fluid.PVTCollectors.Validation.PVT_UN.Thermal\">Thermal</a>: 
Validates thermal output using the quasi-dynamic ISO 9806 formulation.
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://IDEAS.Fluid.PVTCollectors.Validation.PVT_UN.Electrical\">Electrical</a>: 
Validates electrical output using the PVWatts V5 formulation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Due to the absence of rear insulation and the continuous operation of the circulation pump, 
also during periods of negative thermal output, the raw energy deviation of +53.1 % 
is not representative of real-world operation. In practice, the pump would only be activated when thermal gains exceed losses. 
When filtered to periods with positive thermal output, 
the deviation improves to +6.85%. This filtered metric provides a more meaningful assessment of the model performance.
</p>
<p>
The electrical model shows excellent agreement with measurements, with a normalized MAE of 5.2% and nRMSE of 9.9%. 
The model is robust to variations in <code>U<sub>AbsFluid</sub></code>, confirming the reliability of the datasheet-based estimation method.
