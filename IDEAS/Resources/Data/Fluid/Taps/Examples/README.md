## Domestic Hot Water Profiles
Two example profiles for DHW offtake are provided:
- DHW_1year_2adults.txt (dwelling of 2 people: 2 full-time employed adults)
- DHW_1year_2adults_2children.txt (dwelling of 4 people: 1 full-time employed adult, 1 part-time employed adult and 2 schoolgoing children)

The profiles are generated by [StROBe](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe), a tool to simulate stochastic residential occupancy behaviour. \
Both profiles include data for one year (2021) with a time resolution of 15 minutes. The DHW offtake is expressed in l/min.
The profiles can be used in the *TapProfile* model in *IDEAS.Fluid.Taps.TapProfile*.
